	pages={569-583},  
	abstract={Because information flow control mechanisms often rely on an
              underlying authorization mechanism, their security guarantees can be subverted
              by weaknesses in authorization. Conversely, the security of authorization can
              be subverted by information flows that leak information or that influence how
              authority is delegated between principals. We argue that interactions between
              information flow and authorization create security vulnerabilities that have
              not been fully identified or addressed in prior work. We explore how the
              security of decentralized information flow control (DIFC) is affected by three
              aspects of its underlying authorization mechanism: first, delegation of
              authority between principals, second, revocation of previously delegated
              authority, third, information flows created by the authorization mechanisms
              themselves. It is no surprise that revocation poses challenges, but we show
              that even delegation is problematic because it enables unauthorized
              downgrading. Our solution is a new security model, the Flow-Limited
              Authorization Model (FLAM), which offers a new, integrated approach to
              authorization and information flow control. FLAM ensures robust authorization,
              a novel security condition for authorization queries that ensures attackers
              cannot influence authorization decisions or learn confidential trust
              relationships. We discuss our prototype implementation and its algorithm for
              proof search.},

	title={A Calculus for Flow-Limited Authorization},
	year={2016},  
	abstract={Real-world applications routinely make authorization decisions
              based on dynamic computation. Reasoning about dynamically computed authority is
              challenging. Integrity of the system might be compromised if attackers can
              improperly influence the authorizing computation. Confidentiality can also be
              compromised by authorization, since authorization decisions are often based on
              sensitive data such as membership lists and passwords. Previous formal models
              for authorization do not fully address the security implications of permitting
              trust relationships to change, which limits their ability to reason about
              authority that derives from dynamic computation. Our goal is a way to construct
              dynamic authorization mechanisms that do not violate confidentiality or
              integrity. We introduce the Flow-Limited Authorization Calculus (FLAC), which
              is both a simple, expressive model for reasoning about dynamic authorization
              and also an information flow control language for securely implementing various
              authorization mechanisms. FLAC combines the insights of two previous models: it
              extends the Dependency Core Calculus with features made possible by the
              Flow-Limited Authorization Model. FLAC provides strong end-to-end information
              security guarantees even for programs that incorporate and implement rich
              dynamic authorization mechanisms. These guarantees include noninterference and
              robust declassification, which prevent attackers from influencing information
              disclosures in unauthorized ways. We prove these security properties formally
              for all FLAC programs and explore the expressiveness of FLAC with several
              examples.},

RIF automata thus specify how transforming a value alters restrictions for the result. As labels, RIF automata are both expressive and intuitive vehicles for describing allowed information flows. JRIF is a dialect of Java that uses RIF automata for specifying information flow control policies. The implementation of JRIF involved replacing the information flow type system of the Jif language by a RIF-based type system. JRIF demonstrates (i) the practicality and utility of RIF automata, and (ii) the ease with which an existing information flow control system can be modified to support the expressive power of RIF automata.",
